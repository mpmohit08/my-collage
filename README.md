## ⚡ Performance Optimization Strategy

### Database Optimization
```typescript
// Prisma indexes for critical queries
@@index([patientId, scheduledAt]) // Appointment lookups
@@index([doctorId, status, scheduledAt]) // Doctor schedule
@@index([userId, timestamp]) // Audit logs

// Connection pooling
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
  connection_limit = 100
}

// Query optimization
const appointments = await prisma.appointment.findMany({
  where: { doctorId, scheduledAt: { gte: startDate, lte: endDate } },
  select: { 
    id: true, 
    scheduledAt: true, 
    patient: { select: { user: { select: { name: true } } } }
  }, // Only select needed fields
  take: 50, // Pagination
});
```

### Caching Strategy
```typescript
// Redis caching for doctor availability
import { Redis } from 'ioredis';
const redis = new Redis(process.env.REDIS_URL);

// Cache doctor slots for 5 minutes
const cacheKey = `doctor:${doctorId}:slots:${date}`;
const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
if (cached) return JSON.parse(cached);

// Fetch and cache
const slots = await generateTimeSlots(doctorId, date);
await redis.setex(cacheKey, 300, JSON.stringify(slots));
```

### API Route Optimization
```typescript
// Use Next.js Route Handlers with streaming
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(request.url);
  
  // Parallel data fetching
  const [appointments, doctors] = await Promise.all([
    prisma.appointment.findMany({ /* ... */ }),
    prisma.doctor.findMany({ /* ... */ }),
  ]);
  
  return Response.json({ appointments, doctors });
}
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library)
- All API routes (mock Prisma)
- Utility functions (date calculations, validation)
- React components (user interactions)

### Integration Tests
- Authentication flow (register → login → access protected route)
- Appointment booking end-to-end
- Prescription creation workflow

### Load Testing (k6)
```javascript
// 500 concurrent users booking appointments
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 500 }, // Ramp up
    { duration: '5m', target: 500 }, // Sustain
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },   // Ramp down
  ],
  thresholds: {
    http_req_duration: ['p(95)<3000'], // 95% under 3s
  },
};

export default function() {
  const payload = JSON.stringify({
    doctorId: 'xyz',
    scheduledAt: '2025-10-15T10:00:00Z',
    reason: 'Checkup',
  });
  
  const res = http.post('https://yourapp.com/api/appointments', payload, {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  });
  
  check(res, {
    'status is 201': (r) => r.status === 201,
    'response time < 3s': (r) => r.timings.duration < 3000,
  });
  
  sleep(1);
}
```
